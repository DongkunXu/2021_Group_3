# 2021_Group_3

Your team has been asked by a client to develop and 3D model viewer
that will form part of a larger CAD system
• The client needs software that can run on PCs running Windows, MacOS
and Linux
• Your group only needs to develop for 1 of these but you are free to use any
platform you choose.
• The easiest option is Windows as worksheets describe the process in detail for
Windows. If you use another OS you should be reasonably comfortable using
that OS including issuing commands from the command line and where things
are located on the file system (not always obvious on Macs!)
• It must be able to visualise models in two formats:
• The standard STL format
• A proprietary “in-house” format that was used for their old products.

You will write a 3D Model Viewer application and deliver it in
package/installer.
• In semester 1 you’ll need to write a custom library (more on this later)
to allow it load the in-house model format
• The Model Viewer itself will be developed in semester 2.
• You must provide a report outlining how the software was developed,
how the code is structured, and how the software can be operated at
the end of the project.
• Source code for both the library and viewer must also be submitted for
assessment
